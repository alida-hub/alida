Classes related to workflows in Alida.
<p>
Alida extends the concept of operators towards workflows. A workflow is defined as a set of operators to be executed sequentially or in parallel. A workflow is basically defined
in terms of a graph data structure which can be manipulated from external. Note that a workflow is again an operator allowing for nesting operators and workflows.
