[**Alida**](http://www.informatik.uni-halle.de/alida)
(Advanced Library for Integrated Development of Data Analysis Applications)
defines a concept for designing libraries and toolkits in data analysis. It supports and simplifies integrated algorithm development by inherently joining algorithm implementation, automatic analysis process documentation and fully generic generation of user interfaces. In Alida each data analysis or manipulation action is realized in terms of an operator that acts on given data to produce desired output data. As all operators implement a common interface definition, their input and output parameters are accessible in a standardized manner, and they can also be invoked in a predefined way. Alida's concept is well-suited to ease algorithm development and their application to real-world problems by non-expert users. Due to the operator interface definition and the unified handling of operators it is for example possible to automatically generate user interfaces for operators, i.e. graphical frontends or commandline interfaces.

The Alida concept is independent of a specific programming language, however, relies on an object-oriented design. Moreover, in particular Java renders it quite easy to implement the conceptual features of Alida due to its reflection and annotation mechanisms. Anyway the concept has been implemented in two different programming languages.
